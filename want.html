  <p align="left">The benefits of this script are numerous. I myself am amazed 
    by this script, which is about 300 lines long, and growing day by day. </p>
  <p align="left">The main benefit is that, by just chaning one HTML file, the 
    whole site gets change, right on the fly, weather you have 5 pages, or 50 
    or 500. The look and feel of the site remains the same. CSS can be also implemented 
    into this script, to make is <strong>more</strong> dynamic. CSS and this script, 
    its an almost unstoppable combination. </p>
  <p align="left">I had many 
    pages in my site, and had to change all of them, and upload all of them to 
    my server before, when I wanted to make some drastic change in the design 
    of the script. Now, using this script, i just need to edit one template file, 
    the source file, and upload only that, and the whole site gets changed.</p>
  <p align="left">If you want to use this script, please contact me by going to 
    the <a href="index.pl?contact">contact page</a>.</p>
