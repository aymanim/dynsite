  <p><strong><font size="5">About Me</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">I am Ayman J. Singh or AJ. I am 16 years old, still a student, 
    studying Science and Computers at school. In computers I am learning basic 
    C++, nothing else.</p>
  <p align="left">I first began my online journey in 1998, when I got my first 
    email address, aymanjotsingh@hotmail.com. Its a very old email address now, 
    7 years now.</p>
  <p align="left">Then my dad bought me a book by Varif Mohta, called the <strong>WWW 
    for kids and Parents </strong>by <strong>For Dummies Publications. </strong>which 
    introduced me to the world of web site making. The book was aimed at small 
    children and parents, and taught how to make a very basic web site (one page 
    site, using a site editor) on the internet. I experimented and expanded the 
    site to a few more extra pages, but since the beginning, I was interested 
    in providing services. </p>
  <p align="left">In the year 2001, February, my father bought a domain name, 
    which was given to me for control. The domain name is <a href="http://www.talwandi.com/">http://www.talwandi.com</a>. 
    That was my first web site with a domain name. Before that I used to find 
    new ways to make short URLs. I have used many URLs in my experience, like 
    TinyURL, go.to, homepad.com, us.tt and so many many more. Talwandi.com was 
    my first &quot;.com&quot; site. The site was basically for posting information 
    about a village in Northern India, called Talwandi, where my grand father 
    was born, and my ancestors lived. It was targetted to people who wanted to 
    know about this village, but I ruined the site by putting up services, like 
    email and domain name registeration etc... Then I knew that I had to get a 
    domain name for myself.</p>
  <p align="left">In 2002, November, I bought http://www.anamy.com, which was 
    initially an effort of mine, and my best friend Anup Ghatge's to provide some 
    services like free email, free web hosting, and web site development to the 
    visitors. The site did grow quite a bit, but so did my school work, and studies. 
    So, in November 2004, it was closed down.</p>
  <p align="left">But I couldnt stay with out a domain name, and my own site, 
    so In May 2005, I bought AJSNet.com, this very site. It is currently hosted 
    on a very good server, but I am thinking of moving this site to my own web 
    server, located in my bed room :).</p>
  <p align="left">Well, thats my history!</p>
